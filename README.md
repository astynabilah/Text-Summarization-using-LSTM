This code is adapted from a tutorial made by Data Flair (https://data-flair.training/blogs/machine-learning-text-summarization/) for the sake of learning.
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?resource=download) and it is too large to be uploaded in github.
